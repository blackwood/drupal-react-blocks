Here, these are the (ReactJS)[Docs http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html]

This also relies on the (React)[http://drupal.org/project/react] module to serve the library.

To use the JSX syntax do this:

    npm install -g react-tools

    jsx --watch src/ build/

Otherwise you can edit the build/ directly and delete src to add your own react components.
